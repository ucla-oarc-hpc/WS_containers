# Containers for HPC workshop

Using Containers on HPC resources

Charles Peterson, OARC

This workshop will go over how to use container on HPC resources. Containers are a great way to run scientific software on various HPC platforms. Users can create a ‘virtual’ OS to easily install any application and transfer it to any system with container software. This workshop will cover how to build and use containers to run on HPC resources. We will use many examples of scientific software, such as, Nwchem, R and Rstudio, Python and Jupyter, etc. We will work on UCLA’s HPC resource, Hoffman2 (H2). H2 has the container software, Apptainer  where researchers can run containerize applications. To follow along with the instructor, a Hoffman2 account will be needed. Also, it is suggested to have apptainer on a machine you have admin access (a few examples will also use Docker on these machines as well).
